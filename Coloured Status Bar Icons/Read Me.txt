DETAILS
-------
This pack will give you coloured versions of the status bar icons. There are eight colours in total [Blue, Green, Red, Orange, HTC Orange, Pink, Yellow, Black+White]. You can even mix the colours. I didn't create the original Blue icons, I created the other colours and assembled this package. The originals are by syn0ptic and NeoRame so thank them as well.

Please feel free to distribute this but keep this file unmodified.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------
Copy the UIImages, Folder and Bundles Folders into the root of your theme. Respring. Enjoy!
